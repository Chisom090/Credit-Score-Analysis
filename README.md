# Credit Card Predictive Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on credit card predictive analysis, explorative descriptive analysis (EDA), and vintage analysis using Python. It includes the implementation of a RandomForestClassifier for credit risk classification.

## Project Structure
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing EDA, model development, and evaluation.
- **Data:** Dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- **Scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Models:** Saved models and model evaluation results.
- **Visualizations:** Visual representations of data and model performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd credit-card-predictive-analysis`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Explore notebooks and scripts for data analysis and model implementation.
5. Run scripts for training models and evaluating performance.
6. Use saved models for predictions and analysis.
